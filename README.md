# Personal Install scripts
Currently these scripts can do a base install Arch Linux with my preferred configs:
- Hard drive:
  - `/boot`: 500 MiB FAT32
  - Swap: 16 GiB (needed for suspend-on-disk/hibernation)
  - `/`: Rest of free space Ext4


## TODOs
### Things that are definitely needed
- [ ] Desktops (X.Org + Wayland):
  - [ ] KDE
  - [ ] GNOME
- [ ] Programs for everyday use
- [ ] Development programs

### Optional stuff
- [ ] Gaming packages (Steam, Wine, Lutris, etc. etc.?)
- [ ] I'll think of something else later...
